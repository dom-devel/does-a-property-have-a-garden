# Finding properties with a garden on Rightmove

Me and my partner have a small dog and it makes our life 1000x easier if we have some backgarden space where we can let her out.

Unfortunately the garden filter on Rightmove is useless in combination with flats. About 13% of the listed properties actually have gardens.

Thus this wildly overengineered solution where we scrape RM with selenium to get all the properties and then filter them ourselves.
